RAINFALL_PERDICTION
Rainfall prediction is an important task for agriculture and disaster management.
This project uses AI and Machine Learning with Python and TensorFlow to predict rainfall based on historical weather data.
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained using parameters like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
The model provides accurate rainfall predictions to support better planning and decision-making.
